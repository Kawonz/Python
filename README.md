# Password Generator
* This was one of my first <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python<a/> projects. The purpose of creating this project was to practice reading and writing to a file.
> This console program was created to generate a random password using letters, numbers, and symbols. After the password has been created, the user has a choice to save the password to a file.
<br>

When using this program, you will be prompted with the following message:
```
